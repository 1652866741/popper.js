# PopperJS

## Hacking the library

First of all, make sure to have Yarn installed.

Install the development dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

And run the development environment:

```
yarn dev
```

Then, simply open one of the visual examples:

```
# macOS and Linux
open localhost:5000/basic.html

# Windows
start localhost:5000/basic.html
```

Now any change you will made to the source code, will be automatically
compiled, you just need to refresh the page.
